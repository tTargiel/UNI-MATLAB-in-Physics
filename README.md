# UNI-MATLAB-in-Physics  

This repository contains solved exercise sheets from 2nd and 3rd semester of "Physics for ISSP 2" and "Physics for ISSP 3" courses from University of Wroc≈Çaw.  

Those courses were really hard, as they required solving written tutorial exercises, computer labs (those at this repository, done in MATLAB) and also passing the exam from series of lectures.  

If you are interested in understaning those MATLAB programs, feel free to browse through this repository - each of the programs is very precisely commented (in Polish).
